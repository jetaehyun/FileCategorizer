# FileCategorizer

The purpose of this code is to organize a number of files that are not organized in some directory.
Run organize.py through a terminal and provide a address to where the files are located.

Ubuntu: /home/User/Desktop/Folder

The program will scan all files within "Folder" and create new folders and relocate each unique file based on
extension type; the new folders will be located in the same directory.
